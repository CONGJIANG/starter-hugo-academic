I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Université de Montréal under supervision of Prof. [Mireille Schnitzer](https://www.mireilleschnitzer.com/research.html) and Prof. [Denis Talbot](https://www.crchudequebec.ulaval.ca/en/research/researchers/denis-talbot) (Université Laval). 
I received my PhD from the University of Waterloo, where I worked under the supervision of Prof. [Mary E. Thompson](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/people-profiles/mary-thompson) and Prof. [Michael P. Wallace](https://mpwallace.github.io/). 

My main area of research interest centres around advancing the field of causal inference methodology. Specifically, I am deeply engaged in the development of methodologies related to Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) and their practical application in real-world contexts. In the realm of multi-stage treatment decisions, DTRs encompass a sequence of decision rules that leverage patient-specific information, such as age, health status, or prior treatment history, to generate tailored treatment recommendations at each stage. Within this domain, I am particularly focused on addressing two significant practical challenges: the violation of assumptions and the presence of competing outcomes. Currently, my research is centred on harnessing the power of machine learning and nonparametric inference techniques within the realm of causal inference.
