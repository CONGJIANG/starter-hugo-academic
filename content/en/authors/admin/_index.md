I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Université de Montréal under supervision of Prof. [Mireille Schnitzer](https://www.mireilleschnitzer.com/research.html) and Prof. [Denis Talbot] (https://www.crchudequebec.ulaval.ca/en/research/researchers/denis-talbot/). 
I received my PhD from the University of Waterloo, where I worked under the supervision of Prof. [Mary E. Thompson](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/people-profiles/mary-thompson) and Prof. [Michael P. Wallace](https://mpwallace.github.io/). 

My primary research interest is in causal inference methodology. In general, I am interested in developing methodologies in Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs), and implementing such methods in real-world scenarios. In the context of multi-stage treatment decisions, a DTR is a sequence of decision rules which at each stage takes patient information (such as age, health status, or prior treatment) as input, and outputs a treatment recommendation. There are two challenges of practical interest I am focusing on, which are assumption violation and competing outcomes.
